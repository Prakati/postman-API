FastAPI Readme
Introduction
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to produce fast and reliable APIs. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, leveraging their features to provide a powerful and efficient framework.

Features
Fast: FastAPI is one of the fastest frameworks available for building APIs in Python. It leverages asynchronous programming and type hints to achieve high performance.

Easy to Use: FastAPI is designed to be easy to use, with a straightforward syntax and automatic validation of request and response data using Python type hints.

Automatic Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) based on the code, making it easy for developers to understand and test APIs.

Dependency Injection: FastAPI supports dependency injection, making it easy to manage and organize the dependencies of your API functions.

Security: FastAPI comes with built-in security features, including automatic generation of OAuth2 and API key documentation, as well as support for JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication.
